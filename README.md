# json-to-haskell-web

Main repo for the project is [here](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/json-to-haskell)

This one contains the web interface for the project, built with `miso`.

I'm afraid building the project is a bit of a pain at the moment, but you can try the following:

```sh
$ nix-build
```

Look at `miso` and `nix` docs for more help.
